    "    (a particular data structure), providing initial values for state (member variables or attributes), \n",

    "    \n",
    "    Attribute — In Object-oriented programming(OOP), classes and objects have attributes. Attributes are data stored inside a       class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance. ... One can think of attributes as noun or       adjective, while methods are the verb of the class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Behavior — A class's behavior determines how an instance of that class operates; for example, how it will \"react\" if asked      to do something by another class or object or if its internal state changes. Behavior is the only way objects can do           anything to themselves or have anything done to them.     "
